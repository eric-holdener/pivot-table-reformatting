# pivot-table-reformatting
This is a script i made in google apps script for work.
It would take an input of a pivot table from google sheets and output a formatted table to another sheet.
The original data was formatted with checkmarks and dashes, so to format how I wanted I had to make the pivot table count occurences, anything more than 0 would get a check, anything at 0 would get a dash.
